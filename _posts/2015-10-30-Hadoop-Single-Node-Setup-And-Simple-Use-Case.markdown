<p>In below video I showed how to set up and run hadoop quickly in less than 10 min. By using wget I will download index.html file from prateepgedupudi.github.io. Index.html as a input I will run Grep class from hadoop-examples.xxx.jar to count occurrences of prateep.</p>

<p>For development single node setup is enough. This is very useful for debugging. Further reading follow the exactly mentioned order while reading:
1. First chapter in Hadoop In Action (Book)
2. Go through all the examples provided in hadoop-1.2.1\src\examples\org\apache\hadÂ­oop\examples
3. Remaining chapters in Hadoop In Action (Book)
4. Hadoop The Definitive Guide (Book)</p>
