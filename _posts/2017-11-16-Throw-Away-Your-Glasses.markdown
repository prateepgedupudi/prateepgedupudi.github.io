<p>I started using glasses from last 3 years. when I was not using glasses before three years at lease I was trying to read long distance letters. But after wearing of glasses now I can't even recognize the letters, because those are completely blur for me.</p>
<p>I am a great Youtube fan and I came across a video called 'Trow Away Your Glasses' then inspired to do the exercises mentioned in the video. I have attached the video to my post here.  </p>
