<p>I started using glasses from last 3 years. when I was not using glasses before three years at least I was trying to read long distance letters. But after wearing of glasses now I can't even recognize the letters, because those are completely blur for me.</p>
<p>I am a great Youtube fan and I came across a video called 'Throw Away Your Glasses' then inspired to do the exercises mentioned in the video. I have attached the video to my post here. If you have more time then read the book 'Take Off Your Glasses and See by Jacob Liberman' </p>
<p>
    <blockquote>First, Throw away your glasses</blockquote>
    <blockquote >Rotating/moving your eyes 10 times in each direction</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Moving hand hold object from far to near and focusing on it more while it is coming to you nearer</blockquote>
    <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/img/TAYG_2.jpg" alt="">
    <blockquote>Bonus Tip: Rub your hands fastly and put your palms on your eyes for every one hour if your job is related to computers</blockquote>
