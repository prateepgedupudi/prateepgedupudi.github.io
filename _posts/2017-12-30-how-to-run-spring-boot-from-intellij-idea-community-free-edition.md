As many of us are aware Spring recommended the `STS(Spring Tool Suit)` for Spring Boot development. You might aware STS is based on the Eclipse platform and loosing its popularity due to issues in it, on other hand IntelliJ is increasing users base day by day. We have two different editions in IDEA, one is `Community Edition` which is free version and an other one is `Ultimate Edition` which is paid version. I personally feel that Community Edition is more than sufficient for Spring Boot development.    

If you are already using STS and thinking to switch to `IntelliJ IDEA` with out spending a single `$` on it then `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition` is the best choice. Initially you may feel discomfort to work with IDEA due to shortcuts differences from STS. But trust me once you habituated with IDEA then you feel more productive especially in code completion, git, etc.
