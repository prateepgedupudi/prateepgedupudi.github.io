Usually I spend time on learning new concepts in Machine Learning. It is very painful to train the models to get the great accuracy even for simple ML alogorithms until unless we have a huge datset. 

I saw a demo from WWDC session on core ML, how easily they were integrated the predefined models into the iOS apps with not more than 5 lines of code and simple drag and drops. Good thing about the model pipeline is we can create our own model with the simple steps. 

Then I thought of learning to create iOS app myself, went through a free Udacity course and learnt to create an app. Painfull thing is we need to deploy  new versions to the phone with the cord connected to it. 

Now the pain gone with the 'Connect via wireless network  to install, run and debug in Xcode 9 and iOS11' devices. For one time connect the device to mac with cord and enable the setting '' Xcode -> window -> Devices & Simulator -> select the device.To do wireless install, run and debug
